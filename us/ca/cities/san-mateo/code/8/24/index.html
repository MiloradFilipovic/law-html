                <p>No person shall construct any building or premises to be used as a stable for any horse, or mule, or cow, or any number thereof, without first having obtained a special permit therefor from the board of zoning adjustments, specifying the name of the permittee, the location of building or premises to be used as such stable, and the number of animals intended to be kept therein.</p>
                <p>Stables shall be constructed in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and related technical codes of Chapter 23 of this code. In addition, stables shall conform to the following requirements:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> The stable floor shall consist of a six-inch rock base on which is compacted not less than six inches of clay or other approved comparable systems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> There shall be constructed a fly-tight metal or reinforced concrete manure bin. The contents of the bin shall be removed at least twice a week, or more often if ordered by the health officer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> Each stable shall contain a ratproof, concrete, wire mesh or metal or plaster-lined feed room for the storage of feeds other than hay or alfalfa.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> Hay, straw and manure shall not be piled adjacent to the building in a manner that would create a fire hazard. Storage of hay and straw shall be in a manner approved by the fire marshal.</p>
                <p>Stables shall be located on sites as specified in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8/04/020/">Section 8.04.020</a>.

                <p>No person shall maintain as a stable for any horse, or mule, or cow, or any number thereof, any existing structure, not at the effective date of this section used for stable purposes, without first having obtained a special permit therefor from the board of zoning adjustments, specifying the name of the permittee, and the location of the building or premises to be used as such stable and the number of animals intended to be kept therein. Application for the above special permit shall be made with the planning division.</p>
