                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to comply with the state density bonus law (California Government Code section 65915) and to implement the housing element of the San Mateo General Plan, by providing increased residential densities for projects that guarantee that a portion of the housing units will be affordable to very low, low, or moderate-income households, provide senior citizen housing, or include child care facilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to the construction of five or more housing units that satisfy one or more of the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> At least ten percent of the total units are designated for low income households.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> At least five percent of the total units are designated for very low income households.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> A senior citizen housing development as defined in Section 51.3 of the Civil Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> At least ten percent of the total units in a condominium project as defined in subdivision (f) of, or in a planned development as defined in subdivision (k) of, Section 1351 of the Civil Code, are designated for moderate income households, provided that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Definitions. The following terms are defined for purpose of this section:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> "Density bonus" means a density increase, in the amount prescribed by Government Code section 65915, over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date the application is accepted as complete.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> "Low income household" has the meaning set forth in Health and Safety Code section 50079.5 and is a household whose income is equal to or less than eighty percent of the area median income, as published by the California Department of Housing and Community Development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> "Moderate income household" has the meaning set forth in Health and Safety Code section 50093 and is a household whose income is equal to or less than one hundred twenty percent of the area median income, as published by the California Department of Housing and Community Development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> "Senior citizens" means qualifying residents as defined in Section 51.3 of the Civil Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> "Very low income household" has the meaning set forth in Health and Safety Code section 50105 and means a household whose income is equal to or less than fifty percent of the area median income, as published by the California Department of Housing and Community Development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Incentives and Concessions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> City to grant. When an applicant seeks a density bonus as prescribed by Government Code section 65915, the City will grant the number of incentives or concessions required by that section unless it makes one of the following findings:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(A)">(A)</span> The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.3 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Section 65915(c) of the Government Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(B)">(B)</span> The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5 (d)(2), upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The following incentives and concessions are deemed not to have the adverse impact set forth in section (d)(1)(B)	above:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Reduced setbacks or buffers so long as the project remains consistent with the City's General Plan and any applicable design guidelines;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Increased maximum lot coverage so long as the project remains consistent with the City's General Plan and any applicable design guidelines;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Increased maximum Floor Area Ratio so long as the project remains consistent with the City's General Plan and any applicable design guidelines;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(D)">(D)</span> Reduction in parking standards beyond that set forth in Government Code section 65915(p); and.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(E)">(E)</span> In addition to the additional density bonus provided in accordance with Government Code section 65915(g) for land donations within ¼ mile of an applicant's project, provision of the additional density bonus set forth in Government Code section 65915(g) for land dedicated to the City that is located within ½ mile of the applicant's project so long as the applicant demonstrates to the City's satisfaction that building the requisite number of affordable units on-site is infeasible and there is an identified source of funding for the very low income units.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> The City will not, however, provide any direct financial assistance, waive fees or dedication requirements, or provide publicly owned land for a housing development as an incentive or concession.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Waivers and Modifications of Development Standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> Proposal. In accordance with Government Code section 65915(e), an applicant may propose waiver or modification of development standards if they would physically preclude the construction of a development meeting the criteria of section 65915(b) at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by section 65915.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> Grounds for Denial. In accordance with Government Code section 65915(e), the City may deny an applicant's request to waive or modify the City's development standards in any of the following circumstances:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(A)">(A)</span> The application does not conform with the requirements of this section or Government Code section 65915.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)(B)">(B)</span> The applicant fails to demonstrate that the City's development standards physically preclude the utilization of a density bonus on a specific site.</p>
