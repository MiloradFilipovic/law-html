                <p>For the purposes of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/54/">this chapter</a>, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> "BOD" means biochemical oxygen demand. It is a measure of the oxygen used by microorganisms to decompose waste. The larger the quantity of organic waste in the water supply, the greater the demand for oxygen due to greater bacteria so the BOD level will be high.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> "Commercial" means all uses other than residential.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> "Connection" means each separate residential, lodging, or commercial and industrial, and institutional unit connected to an internal plumbing drainage system or external sewer lateral.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> "Customer class" means or represents the structure or designation by which a user is classified based on industry wastewater standards for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS). There are five customer classes, one for residential and four for commercial customers. Customer classes are further defined as shown below.</p>
                <p>	Class A – Standard Strength. All residential users including, but not limited to, single-family dwelling units, duplex units, and multi-family dwelling units.</p>
                <p>	Class B – Standard Strength. Commercial users, including, but not limited to, offices, retail establishments, hotel and motels without restaurants, mixed uses (high strength comprises &lt; 25% of flow).</p>
                <p>	Class C – Moderate Strength. Commercial users, including, but not limited to, hotels and motels with restaurants, industrial laundries, mixed use (high strength comprises 25% to 75% of flow), supermarkets with food preparation, bakeries, meat or seafood counters.</p>
                <p>	Class D – High Strength. Commercial users, including, but not limited to, restaurants, wholesale bakeries, mortuaries, mixed use (high strength comprises &gt;75% of flow).</p>
                <p>	Class E – Special. Commercial users that may require a determination on a case by case basis as prescribed by <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/54/030/#(e)">Section 3.54.030(e)</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> "Director of Public Work" means Director of Public Works or designee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> "Fixture unit" means a unit of measurement for computing waste flow volumes for each plumbing fixture as set forth in the Uniform Plumbing Code as then adopted by the City in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/">Title 23</a> of this code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> "Inordinately high" means usage in one month that exceeds usage by 150% of the five months of average usage. An example follows. Usage for November is 37, December is 76, January is 20, February is 16, and March is 17. The five month average is 33.20. Usage in any one month in excess of 49.8 (i.e., 150% of 33.2) would be considered inordinately high. Therefore December would be found to be inordinately high and dropped from the calculation as required in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/54/030/">Section 3.54.030</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> "Institutional" means uses by churches, clubs, hospitals, lodges, community care facilities, schools, and public buildings, whether privately or publicly owned, and whether profit or nonprofit in operation. Such entities shall be considered commercial.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> "Residential" means a place designed or used for residence or dwelling, whether permanent or temporary in nature. Residential does not include hotels or motels.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> "Restaurant" means restaurant, fast-food, and drive-in establishments, as defined in the Zoning Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> "SS" means suspended solids. They are the solids which can be removed from the wastewater by physical or mechanical means, such as sedimentation or filtration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> "Strength" means the level of BOD and SS in the wastewater.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> "User" means any person or persons, a legal entity, or a business, commercial or manufacturing enterprise, which uses the sewer system and disposal facilities of the City in any manner, and whether a property owner or tenant.</p>

                <p>The Council by ordinance will establish the annual charge to be assessed per 100 cubic feet of water used, upon the users thereof, for the privilege of the use of the sewer system and disposal facilities of the City for each fiscal year, to be effective 30 days after adoption.</p>
                <p>Each user will be assigned to one of the five customer classes as determined by the Director of Public Works in accordance with the principal activity conducted upon the premises, or in accordance with the use of the premises. Users with the same principal activity will receive the same customer classification. The five customer classes are hereby established as defined in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/54/020/#(d)">Section 3.54.020(d)</a> Definitions, and will be assessed a sewer service charge as described below. The purpose of the classification is to establish a sewer service charge system based upon flow and waste strength that will insure an equitable recovery of capital and operating costs.</p>
                <p>The sewer service charge is based on a rate and annual water usage. The total revenue raised will be determined based on winter water consumption. The "base sewer service charge rate" is established by adopting a rate based on the fund's financial plan and will be per 100 cubic feet of annual water used except as qualified as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> For Class C – Moderate strength users, the base rate multiplied by 1.48.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> For Class D – High strength users, the base rate multiplied by 2.24.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> For greenhouse or nursery users, the base rate multiplied by 0.50.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The annual charge for each user shall be the sewer service user fee computed pursuant to this section or a minimum charge based on an average 2.5 CCF per month times the base rate, whichever is greater. The minimum charge will apply to all parcels with usage greater than zero during the year. In determining the usage, in cases where the five-month average is not representative of the actual average sewer use during the year, then the entire fiscal year water use record may be considered in determining the yearly usage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The City may enter into service contracts for establishment of an annual user charge that is different from the charge calculated pursuant to this section with other governmental entities or with users whose operations are determined to have unusual or unique circumstances related to return of water to the sewer system. Such a contract shall be subject to approval by the Director of Public Works and may be proposed at any time during the year.</p>
                <p>Annual water usage, for the purpose of establishing this charge, shall be determined by computing the average monthly metered flow billed to each parcel, to the nearest 10 cubic feet, during the immediately past five months of November, December, January, February, and March, and multiplying this monthly average by 12, the total months in a year. The metered flow data billed for those months shall be that contained in the official records of the California Water Service Company, Estero Municipal Improvement District, Belmont Water District, or any entity or successor that provides water service to that particular parcel.</p>
                <p>In the event that billings show no water usage during any one or more of the specified five months, the average shall be computed by using the remaining months' usage and number that do show water usage.</p>
                <p>In the event that one month of the five specified months shows an inordinately high or low usage, that month shall be dropped from the calculation and the remaining four months' usage shall be averaged and multiplied by 12 to establish the charge.</p>
                <p>The water usage for each user shall be determined after March 31st of each year, but sufficiently prior to the Council's review pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/54/070/">Section 3.54.070</a>, to allow for public and Council study prior to the review.</p>
