                <p>Application for planned unit development shall be made to the Department of Community Development.

At the same time the Zoning Administrator may require that such other applications as are appropriate to the implementation of the plan be submitted, or he or she may require that they be submitted at a later date after approval of the development plan. Any such applications submitted with the plan will go forward to the Planning Commission and the City Council, and shall be effective only after action by the City Council.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Review by City Council.

                <p>Following approval of concept, if such items have not been applied for in conjunction with development plan approval under Section 27.62.210, the applicant shall apply for site plan and architectural review and approval pursuant to Section 27.08.030 for each separate phase of building construction; site development permit, pursuant to Chapter 23.40 of this code; subdivision approval, where applicable, pursuant to Title 26 of this code; and heritage tree permit, where applicable, pursuant to Chapter 10.52 of this code, and any other applicable provision of this code.</p>

Each such additional permit, as well as the special permit for the planned development, shall itself be governed by the time limitations of Section 27.08.060. The permit shall run with the land and may be exercised by the successor to the applicant.</p>
                <p>A further extension, for a period not to exceed one year, may be granted upon a proper showing that the delay in acting upon the approval granted has been occasioned by action or inaction of governmental agencies and is not due to delay or default on the part of the applicant.</p>
